# MLOps Fundamentals

## What is MLOps?

### Definition
**MLOps** (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning (ML) and DevOps to standardize and streamline the ML lifecycle.

Think of it as **"DevOps for Machine Learning"** - applying software engineering practices to ML workflows.

## The Problem MLOps Solves

### Traditional Data Science Workflow
```
1. Data Scientist works in Jupyter Notebook
2. Builds amazing model on their laptop
3. "It works on my machine!"
4. Throws model.pkl file over the wall to engineering
5. Model fails in production
6. Finger pointing begins...
```

### Common Problems:

#### 1. **Reproducibility Issues**
```python
# Notebook cell #47 (run 3 months ago)
model = RandomForest(n_estimators=???)  # What parameters were used?
# Can't reproduce the same results!
```

#### 2. **Environment Differences**
```
Data Scientist: Python 3.8, pandas 1.3.0
Production: Python 3.6, pandas 1.1.0
Result: Model crashes with version conflicts
```

#### 3. **Manual Processes**
```
1. Download data manually
2. Clean data in notebook
3. Train model manually
4. Copy-paste results to email
5. Manually deploy if results look good
```

#### 4. **No Monitoring**
```
Week 1: Model accuracy = 85%
Week 10: Model accuracy = 65%
Nobody noticed until customers complained!
```

## MLOps Solution

### Systematic Approach
```
Data → Pipeline → Training → Testing → Deployment → Monitoring → Feedback
   ↑                                                               ↓
   ←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Continuous Improvement ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

### Key Principles:

#### 1. **Automation**
```python
# Instead of manual steps:
@flow
def training_pipeline():
    data = load_data()
    processed = preprocess(data)
    model = train_model(processed)
    deploy_if_good(model)
```

#### 2. **Version Control Everything**
```
Git Repository:
├── Code (Python scripts)
├── Data (versions/checksums)
├── Models (MLflow registry)
├── Config (hyperparameters)
└── Infrastructure (Docker, Terraform)
```

#### 3. **Reproducibility**
```yaml
# config.yaml - Everything is documented
model:
  type: "RandomForest"
  n_estimators: 100
  random_state: 42

data:
  version: "v2.1"
  preprocessing: "standard"
```

#### 4. **Monitoring & Feedback**
```python
# Continuous monitoring
if model_accuracy < threshold:
    trigger_retraining()
    alert_team()
```

## MLOps vs DevOps

### Traditional DevOps
```
Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor
```
**Focus**: Application code

### MLOps Adds:
```
Data → Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor
 ↓       ↓       ↓      ↓       ↓        ↓
Data    Model   Model  Model   Model    Model
Prep    Train   Valid  Test    Serve    Monitor
```
**Focus**: Data + Model + Code

### Key Differences:

| Aspect | DevOps | MLOps |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Data** | Static | Dynamic, changes over time |
| **Testing** | Unit/Integration | + Data validation, Model validation |
| **Deployment** | Code artifacts | + Model artifacts, Data pipelines |
| **Monitoring** | System metrics | + Model performance, Data drift |
| **Versioning** | Code | + Data versions, Model versions |

## Why MLOps Matters

### Business Impact:

#### 1. **Faster Time to Market**
```
Traditional: 6-12 months from idea to production
MLOps: 2-6 weeks from idea to production
```

#### 2. **Higher Model Quality**
```
Without MLOps: 40% of models make it to production
With MLOps: 85% of models make it to production
```

#### 3. **Reduced Costs**
```
Manual processes: 80% of ML engineer time
Automated MLOps: 20% of ML engineer time
```

#### 4. **Better Reliability**
```
Traditional: Models fail silently
MLOps: Automated monitoring and alerts
```

## Common MLOps Challenges

### 1. **Data Dependencies**
```python
# Traditional software
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # Always works the same

# ML function
def predict(data):
    return model(data)  # Depends on data quality!
```

### 2. **Model Drift**
```
Training data (2020): "awesome", "great", "terrible"
Production data (2023): "fire", "mid", "cringe"  # New vocabulary!
```

### 3. **Testing Complexity**
```python
# Traditional testing
assert add(2, 3) == 5  # Exact answer

# ML testing
assert 0.8 < model_accuracy < 0.9  # Probabilistic answer
```

### 4. **Reproducibility**
```python
# Many sources of randomness:
train_test_split(random_state=42)
RandomForest(random_state=42)
tf.random.set_seed(42)
numpy.random.seed(42)
```

## Key Takeaways

### For Beginners:
1. **Start Simple**: Don't try to implement everything at once
2. **Focus on Basics**: Good code structure and version control
3. **Automate Gradually**: Add automation piece by piece
4. **Monitor Early**: Plan monitoring from day one

### Core MLOps Practices:
1. **Version Everything**: Code, data, models, configs
2. **Automate Testing**: Data validation, model validation
3. **Use Pipelines**: Reproducible, automated workflows
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Performance, drift, errors

### Success Metrics:
- **Time to deploy**: How fast can you get models to production?
- **Model reliability**: How often do models fail?
- **Team productivity**: How much time is spent on manual tasks?
- **Model performance**: How well do models perform over time?

## Next Steps

After understanding these fundamentals:
